Hansim
==============

A strategy simulator for the well-known cooperative card
game Hanabi.  This directory contains code for two strategies,
both using hat guessing to allow hints to be given
to each player simultaneously.  

The first strategy, contained in the files that begin 
with rec_, is an actionable clues based strategy.  The
second strategy, whose files are prefixed with info_,
comprise a more complex strategy that achieves a perfect
score 75% of the time.


Compilation
===============

With the GCC compiler, to compile the rec_ strategy, use
g++ rec_main.cpp
To compile the info_ strategy, use
g++ info_main.cpp

For other compilers, just build either rec_main.cpp or
info_main.cpp.
